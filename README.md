# TTGO-T-Display-Xdrip-
A small Arduino Programm to display the Bloodsugar Values from Xdrip on the TTGO T-display over wifi.

The program Creates a Wifi Hotspot. You need to connect your device to the Hotspot. The Current standard settings us die SSID "BZ" with the password "Blutzucker"

In your phone you need to set a Permanent IP Adress to ensure the phone always has the same IP. The Standard setting is: "192.168.4.2"

In Xdrip you need to activate the open web client and set the Password "Blutzucker". This can be changed but you need to paste the SHA-1 hash of the Password in the Code.
